todo-list:

1. menu itself: through media queries should support mobile and desktop!
2. controls
3. sync those controls with actual code (tricky because i have no idea how it works in detail lmao)





hut altitude is stored in map.js, as hut_altitude
also hut altitude is directly stored in huts_with_coords.json


make a function which takes min alt and maxAlt, that get applied with a seperate menu button
fetch maybe should take those parameters?
